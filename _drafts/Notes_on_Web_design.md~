Adding Style with CSS
------
------
To add presentation information to web pages, web designers use a style language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). With CSS, you can display information for different devices, such as a smartphone, tablet, or computer screen, lay out page designs, and control typogra- phy, color, and many other presentation characteristics.

A style sheet is a set of style rules that describes the display characteristics of a document.

HTML5
------
 HTML5 is intended to not only describe page structure and layout, but offers a variety of new features:
 Logical sectioning elements, such as < nav > (for a navigation bar), < section >, < header >, and < footer >
 Elements designed for different types of rich media, including < video > and < audio >
 Animations that play directly in the browser window without plug-ins using the < canvas > element
 Support for applications in the browser, including drag and drop, local data storage, and background data processing
