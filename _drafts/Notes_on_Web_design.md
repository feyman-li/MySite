Adding Style with CSS
------
------
To add presentation information to web pages, web designers use a style language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). With CSS, you can display information for different devices, such as a smartphone, tablet, or computer screen, lay out page designs, and control typogra- phy, color, and many other presentation characteristics.

A style sheet is a set of style rules that describes the display characteristics of a document.

HTML5
------
 HTML5 is intended to not only describe page structure and layout, but offers a variety of new features:
 Logical sectioning elements, such as < nav > (for a navigation bar), < section >, < header >, and < footer >
 Elements designed for different types of rich media, including < video > and < audio >
 Animations that play directly in the browser window without plug-ins using the < canvas > element
 Support for applications in the browser, including drag and drop, local data storage, and background data processing
 ------
 
The HTML5 elements that are designed for page layout include the following:

*   < header >—Contains the page header content
*   < nav > —Contains the navigation elements for the page
*   < article > —Contains the primary page content. This element is also used to designate content designed for syndication or redistribution.
*   < section >—Defines sections or groupings of the page content, typically with its own heading
*   < aside > —Contains additional content such as a quote or sidebar < figure >—Contains images for the article content
*   < footer > —Contains the page footer content, typically information such as copyrights, policies and legal information, and contact information
